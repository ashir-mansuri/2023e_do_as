## Self management approach for company's employees

At Morningstar, self-management means that employees have a high degree of autonomy in how they work, who they work with, and what they work on. This approach is based on the idea that employees are most motivated and productive when they have a sense of ownership and control over their work.

One of the key elements of Morningstar's self-management system is the absence of traditional management roles. Instead of managers, Morningstar has a system of "colleague letters," which are agreements between employees that outline their roles, responsibilities, and goals. Colleague letters are negotiated annually between employees and their peers, and they serve as the foundation for how work is structured and organized within the company.

## Mission statement style to encourage employees

It is important aspect of Morningstar's self-management system is the use of "mission statements." Each employee is responsible for creating their own mission statement, which outlines their personal and professional goals, as well as how they plan to contribute to the company's overall mission. Mission statements are reviewed and updated annually, and they serve as a way for employees to align their work with their personal and professional aspirations.

In addition to colleague letters and mission statements, Morningstar also has a system of "peer reviews," which are used to evaluate employee performance. Peer reviews are conducted annually by colleagues who work closely with the employee being evaluated, and they focus on the employee's contributions to the company's mission, as well as their adherence to the company's core values.
